# Multi-objective planning

This is the code repository of the multi-objective planners developed as part of
the scientific publication:

Florian Geißer and Patrik Haslum and Sylvie Thiébaux and Felipe Trevizan
Admissible Heuristics for Multi-Objective Planning
in Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling
2022

This repository is currently under construction and we will upload code and
benchmark set in the near future. In case you require early access to code or
benchmark domains please contact the authors.
